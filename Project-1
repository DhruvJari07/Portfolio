# Project-1: Content based & collaborative movie recommendation system

* This project focused on developing a recommendation system for movies using both content-based and collaborative-based approaches. The goal was to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and similarities with other users.

* User Analysis and Data Mining: User movie ratings and preferences were analyzed using data mining techniques. This involved extracting relevant information from the dataset to understand user preferences and behavior.

* Content-based Recommendation: Movie features such as genre, director, and actors were extracted to create a content-based recommendation system. This approach aimed to suggest movies similar to the ones users have enjoyed in the past.

* Collaborative Filtering Model: A collaborative filtering model was developed to generate personalized recommendations. This model considered user ratings and similarities with other users to identify movies that users with similar tastes have enjoyed.

* Machine Learning Algorithms: The recommendation system was optimized using machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, random forest, Pearson correlation function, and matrix factorization. These algorithms helped improve the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations.

* Performance Evaluation: The performance of the recommendation system was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. This assessment provided insights into the effectiveness of the system and allowed for potential enhancements.

* Results and Findings Presentation: The project concluded with the presentation of results and findings in a clear and concise manner. The recommendations generated by the system and the performance metrics were shared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented solution.
